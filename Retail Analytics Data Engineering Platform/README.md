# Retail Analytics Data Engineering Pipeline

This project is a small retail analytics ETL pipeline built using Python.
The main goal of the project was to practice core data engineering concepts
such as data ingestion, transformation, validation, and basic automation.

This is a learning-focused project and is not intended for production use.

## What the project does
- Loads sample retail sales data from CSV
- Applies simple transformations for analytics
- Validates output using tests
- Runs automated checks using GitHub Actions

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- PostgreSQL (optional, not required to run locally)
- Pytest
- GitHub Actions

## Project Structure
- `src/` contains ETL logic
- `data/` contains sample input data
- `tests/` contains basic validation tests
